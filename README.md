## Overview

My first app using React.js! I purposefully choose a simple project in order to focus on acclimatizing myself to the React world. The vast majority of my effort was spent studying React docs to ensure I understood, as best I could, what was happening in the flow of the code. Once I felt I grasped the basics, I set up the development environment (prettier & eslint). Finally, I broke the app down into subcomponents, each styled with unique css. The app build itself was extremely easy, allowing me to get comfortable with creating the jsx and css for each subcomponent with ease.
